# This example Python script ingest data forwarded by the devices via an AWS API Gateway configured in Jamf Protect >> Actions
# and then creates a Jira ticket to alert admins of new Alerts.
# The API Gateway needs to be configured to trigger a Lambda, which runs this script, upon invocation.

# The script performs the following:
# - Ingest JSON file of an Alert forwarded by AWS API Gateway.
# - Obtain from AWS Secret Manager the following:
#     Jamf Pro API username
#     Jamf Pro API password
#     Jira API auth key
#     Jira email address
#     VirusTotal token
# - Extract from the JSON file the Alert's severity, timestamp, threat name and hostname of the device
# - Obtain a bearer token from Jamf Pro
# - Performs an API call to Jamf Pro to check if the device is enrolled and grab it's device_id
# - If a threat signature is present in the JSON file, invoke VirusTotal API to collect the details of the threat
# - Create a Jira ticket containing the Alert's details, a link to the Alert in Jamf Protect,
# - a link to the device in Jamf Pro and a link to the threat in VirusTotal, if present.

# Keep the following in mind when using this script:
#
# - You must define the protect_instance, jira_url, jamf_url, and severity_check variables to
#   match your Jamf Protect and Jamf Pro environment.
#   The protect_instance variable is your tenant name (eg. your-tenant), which is included in your tenant URL (eg.
#   https://your-tenant.protect.jamfcloud.com).
#   The jamf_url variable is your instance name (eg. your-instance), which is included in your tenant URL (eg.
#   https://your-instance.jamfcloud.com).
# - You must also define the severity_check. To create a Jira ticket for any Alert, set to 0, otherwise set accordingly to which level
#   of Alerts you'd like to be sent:
#    1 = Low
#    2 = Medium
#    3 = High
# - Example: setting severity_check = "3" will only create a Jira ticket for an alert that are categorized as High.
# - You must define the project_key which is your Jira board identifier (https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-projects/#api-group-projects)
# - You will neeed to define the SecretId for AWS Secret Manager and the associated api_user, api_password, jira_token, jira_user and virustotal_api.
# - You must define the jira_token and jira_user and add it into Secret Manager (https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/intro/#authentication)
# - You must create an account on VirusTotal to obtain an api key and add it into Secret Manager  https://developers.virustotal.com/reference/getting-started
# - You need to add in Secret Manager the api username and password for Jamf Pro
# - This script requires the 3rd party Python library 'requests'
# - This script requires the AWS Python library 'boto3'
